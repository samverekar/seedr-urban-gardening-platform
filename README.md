# Seedr — Urban Gardening Services & Platform

## Product Overview

Seedr began as a **hands-on urban gardening services company** and evolved into a **technology-enabled platform** focused on bringing structured gardening solutions to modern urban households.

The company operated at the intersection of:
- Physical service delivery
- Skill training and workforce enablement
- Digital product experimentation in agri-tech

Seedr addressed a clear gap in urban environments where demand for home gardening existed, but knowledge, maintenance, and execution were fragmented.

## Founder Role & Ownership

I co-founded Seedr and led:
- Business model design
- Service operations
- Training programs
- Platform direction during the digital transition

This was an operator-led company before it became a product-led initiative.

## Offline Operations (Baseline System)

Before any platform work, Seedr functioned as a **service-first business**:

- ~1,000 home gardens serviced
- ~80,000 sq ft of active home garden area
- 300+ homemakers trained in gardening skills

Training was not marketing-led; it was operationally required to scale service quality and consistency.

---

## Workforce Enablement Model

A core part of Seedr was **human capacity building**:

- Homemakers were trained as gardening operators
- Skill development enabled repeatable service delivery
- Created localised, distributed execution instead of central teams

This reduced operational cost while increasing service reach.

## Digital Transition & Platform Thinking

Seedr later transitioned toward a **technology-enabled model**:

- Digitisation of service workflows
- Customer lifecycle understanding (onboarding → maintenance)
- Product decisions driven by real operational constraints

The pivot required:
- Understanding customer behaviour beyond one-time services
- Translating offline processes into structured digital flows
- Designing tech that supported, not replaced, human execution

---

## Product & Market Constraints

- Gardening outcomes are time-bound and seasonal
- Heavy dependency on physical execution
- Customer trust built through results, not interfaces
- Low tolerance for abstraction or over-automation

Technology had to respect biological, environmental, and human limits.

---

## Key Learnings

- Services businesses expose real unit economics early
- Platforms built on physical operations must start ops-first
- Training and workforce design can be stronger moats than software
- Digitisation succeeds only after process clarity

Seedr was foundational in shaping my approach to building products on top of fragile, real-world systems.

---

## Outcome

Seedr demonstrated that:
- Urban agri-tech requires deep operational grounding
- Digital platforms must evolve from lived execution
- Impact and sustainability come from system design, not features
